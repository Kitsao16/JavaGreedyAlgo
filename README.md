# Emergency Medical Supplies Delivery System

This code provides a basic framework and assumes a simplified model without considering real-time data feeds or advanced optimization techniques. You may need to adapt and expand upon this code to fit your specific requirements and incorporate additional functionalities.

This Java program simulates the delivery of emergency medical supplies to hospitals during crises, such as natural disasters or pandemics. It utilizes a greedy algorithm to optimize delivery routes and ensure timely delivery of supplies.

## Features

- **Hospital Class:** Represents a hospital with attributes such as name, location, urgency level, and required supplies.
- **DeliveryVehicle Class:** Represents a delivery vehicle with attributes such as capacity, current location, and loaded supplies.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Implements a greedy algorithm to optimize delivery routes based on the urgency of hospital needs and vehicle capacity.
- **Simulation:** Simulates the loading and delivery of supplies to hospitals.
- **Statistical Methods:** Utilizes statistical methods such as calculating average, standard deviation, variance, and Z-scores to analyze delivery performance and optimize delivery strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `EmergencySupplyDeliverySimulation.java` file using a Java compiler or IDE.
3. View the console output to observe the simulated delivery process and results.
